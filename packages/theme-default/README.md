## Movie Masher Theme Plug-in
This module is a reference implementation of a theme plug-in. It exports SVG icons and CSS utilized by a client implementation like
[@moviemasher/client-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moviemasher/client-react).
Its imports are all specified as peer dependencies.

This theme implementation utilizes
[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) 
to provide the widest selection of icons. Learn more about visually customizing the user interface in the
[Styling Overview](https://moviemasher.com/docs/Styling.html).
