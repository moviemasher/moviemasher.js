## Core Library

This module is a peer dependency of both
[@moviemasher/client-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moviemasher/client-react) and
[@moviemasher/server-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moviemasher/server-express) modules, and not typically installed directly. It exports core interfaces, classes, factories, utility methods, enumerations, and types related to creating, managing and rendering video edit decision lists.
