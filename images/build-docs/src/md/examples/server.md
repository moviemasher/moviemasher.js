## Server Example

The following shell command installs the server and required packages to your NPM project,
saving the former to the `dependencies` array in your **package.json** file.

```shell
npm install @moviemasher/lib-server --save
```

The script below can then be included in your project and triggered in a variety of ways. The most straightfoward is to simply pass its path directly to node.

<fieldset>

<legend>server.js</legend>


```js
// src/server.ts
import { Host, HostDefaultOptions } from "@moviemasher/lib-server";
var host = new Host(HostDefaultOptions());
host.start();
```


</fieldset>

The script first requires MovieMasherServer, then destructures what's needed from it. In this example we're just grabbing the `Host` class and corresponding `HostDefaultOptions` function. We call the later with the desired port number, and then pass the options it returns as arguments to the class constructor. Finally, the `start` method of the new instance is called to start the ExpressJS server. 

While the server is running, requests can be made to http://localhost:8570 following half a dozen APIs that save data, handle uploads, render video, etc. 

### _Please note_
This example installs an FFmpeg build that has limited rendering capabilities due to lack of support of SVG files. Typically a custom build is utilized instead. Learn more about integrating your own services in the [Server Developer Guide](https://moviemasher.com/docs/ServerDeveloper.html).
