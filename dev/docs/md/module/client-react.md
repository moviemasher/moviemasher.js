## client-react

The 
[@moviemasher/client-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moviemasher/client-react)
module is imported by the higher-level 
[@moviemasher/client-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moviemasher/client-lib), 
library, and not typically installed directly. It exports 
types, interfaces, classes, and functions needed at runtime in the client.

This module is built from code and configuration available in the
[Movie Masher Github Repository](https://github.com/moviemasher/moviemasher.js).
The NPM distribution includes TypeScript source code files, as well as a  
minified JavaScript file intended to be imported directly from the client. 
All source files are distributed as a single JavaScript file. The JavaScript 
includes source maps to the TypeScript for easier debugging.
